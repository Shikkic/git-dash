# Git-dash

Git dash is a dashboard interface for staying current with what your freinds on Github are working on!
The goal was to make it easier to stay relevant with peoples interests and projects to help make reaching out easier.

## Installation 

**Note**: Github uses the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), a [developer account and app application](https://developer.github.com/program/) are required

[Fork this repo](http://www.github.com/git-dash/fork) this repo, cloneit and then run:

```
npm install
```

... which installs the dependencies, and you should be good to go!

```
node index.js
```

### Warnings

- You will need a `Github Client ID` and a `Github Client Secret` stored as enviroment variables.

Ex: bash_profile
```bash
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID='[oiwhpiuqhniqo2y8;ioq2u8oqdhoihakjsdkjasgiuawh'
export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=';epoajslknzlaspidjhqwlkdnwlakdnasndlkasbdl'
```

I hope you like it!
