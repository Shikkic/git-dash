# Git-dash

Git dash is a dashboard interface for staying current with what your freinds on Github are working on!
The goal was to make it easier to stay relevant with peoples interests and projects to help make reaching out easier.

## TODOS

- FE should be completely refactor to use AMD
- Implement Collections and actuallly use models/views correctly
- Implement a popup/modal-offclick overlay
- Design and Implemeant large profile cards
- Lookinto left hand column user profile 

## Dev Installation 

**Note**: Github uses the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), a [developer account and app application](https://developer.github.com/program/) are required

[Fork this repo](http://www.github.com/git-dash/fork), clone it and then run:

```
npm install
```

... which installs the dependencies, and you should be good to go!

```
gulp
```

### Warnings

- You will need a `Github Client ID` and a `Github Client Secret` stored as enviroment variables.

Ex: bash_profile
```bash
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID='[oiwhpiuqhniqo2y8;ioq2u8oqdhoihakjsdkjasgiuawh'
export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=';epoajslknzlaspidjhqwlkdnwlakdnasndlkasbdl'
```

I hope you like it!
